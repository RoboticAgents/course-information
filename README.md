### Description

A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field's technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. 

Prerequisite: Introductory computer science course.

Focus: Quantitative Reasoning, Covoc Learning.

### Objectives

Complex modern digital problems often require sophisticated computer programs, or agents, that act autonomously on behalf of their users and interact with hardware. This course will introduce students to the foundational principles behind robotic agents and to the civic issues, public challenges, and opportunities in this field. Areas of discussion include, but are not limited to sensors, perception, robot navigation and localization, motion planning, machine learning in robots, state of the art robotic applications, robotics in K-12 education, renewable energy, misuse of intelligent software and hardware, and various public issues utilizing agent/robotic systems as a solution.

The course will introduce students to the practice of agent-based and robotic systems while covering both the well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline. The course also invites students to design and develop several robotic system applications and to assess the correctness of their implementations. This will require students to work both with hardware and with software throughout the course. Moreover, the course will ask students to reflect on several public problems at local, national and international level that are or can be solved using robotic technologies and to study social systems behind them. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students will enhance their ability to write and speak about agent-based and robotic systems in a clear and concise fashion. Through civic engagement activities, students will also strengthen their skill of clearly communicating technical details to the general public.

### Outcomes

At the completion of this course, a student must be comfortable with fundamental concepts and practical techniques in robotic systems and be aware of current public issues involving this area. When given a new relevant problem, students should be able to select proper robotic agent-based tools and techniques and implement a complete application that uses them to solve the stated problem. Students must also be able to develop a toolkit of robotic concepts that they can use in the context of the solutions to real-world problems. Furthermore, students must be capable of identifying a public problem applicable to the field of study, and find and apply an appropriate solution using robotic and agent-based systems. Finally, students must be able to critically reflect on the civic engagement interactions and influences of any societal forces on the problem their civic action is addressing.

### Materials

There is no required textbook for this course. All reading material will be provided by the instructor and linked on the [course schedule](#Schedule).

#### Class Activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.

#### Community Engagement

A significant portion of the course asks the students to study and reflect on public problems related to the field of robotics. As a part of civic learning in this course you will be required to engage in the community. This will mainly involve developing software and hardware to be presented to our local community and then participating in appropriate outreach events. 

#### Projects

Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, these team-based assignments invite students to experiment with various tools and techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting your robotic agent system. Additionally, you will be required to submit reflections on the civic learning components if relevant to the particular project.  To best ensure that students are ready to develop software  after graduation, students will complete most of the lab assignments in teams. Many of the lab assignments in this course will expect students to give both a presentation and a demonstration of the system that they created.

#### Presentations

At various points of the course, students will engage with learning "hot topics" and report on their findings to our class community.

#### Exam

The exam will cover all of the material in its associated module. The date for the exam will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students will be expected to take the exams on the
scheduled dates. As voted by the members of the class, the second community outreach event can be used instead of the second exam.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least one day in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

#### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).
