# Community Guidelines

## Course community guidelines to govern interactions in Robotic Agents

### Interactions in class and lab
 - Ensure your actions and language create a welcoming environment.
 - Be respectful.
 - Respect others' privacy and boundaries.
 - Practice the 3 pillars of social interaction: **Humility, Trust, and Respect**
 - Do the right thing.
 - Be helpful.
 - Be responsible for what you do.
 
### Interactions in the local community
- DO NOT CREATE A ROBOT OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
- Be knowledgeable of potential impacts on your community. 
- Be respectful to community members.
- Be mindful of your surroundings.
- Be careful of what you may do to the local environment.
- Guide local people if they want to use the robots.

### Interactions on Discord
- Be courteous about any questions asked by a classmate.
- Respond to questions when you can.
- Check it regularly (particularly if that is your main communication method for group work).

### Interactions on GitHub
 - GitHub flow should be followed at all times.
 - Be respectful.
 - Don't touch another person's equipment or computer unless given permission.
 - PRs should be reviewed thoroughly and in a timely manner. Should they not, gentle reminders are okay.
 - Comments and criticism should be respectful and constructive. Provide alternative solutions.
 - Don't sneak feature requests into PR reviews. Focus only on what the intended functionality of the PR is supposed to cover.
 - Branches should follow the naming scheme i.e. "feature/some-cool-feature", "fix/some-cool-bugfix", "doc/some-cool-documentation". The important part being the prefixes of `feature`, `fix`, `doc`.
 - Commits should be descriptive and small.
   - For example, `updated some code` is not a good commit message, `Add pathfinding base class` is a much better commit message.
   - Try to keep commit messages as **less than 50 characters** however this is a soft guideline. You can always add extra information in the optional extended message by appending a second `-m "MESSAGE"` to your `git commit`.
   - Try to start commits with a word such as `Fix`, `Add`, or `Remove`, where applicable.
   - In general, these are soft guidelines that may not always apply but try to adhere to them whenever possible and appropriate.
 - PRs should be reviewed by at least one other team member.
 - PRs should follow similar guidelines as commit messages in relation to title length.
   - Again, while there is no hard limit on title length, **less than 50 characters** is preferred.
   - Include extra details in the body of the PR.
 - If not added to a PR request don't review it without permission of the creator.

### Teamwork
 - Don't be afraid to hold each other accountable (in a respectful manner).
 - Host brief team reflection at the end of a project to discuss what went well and what could use improvement (This should be respectful constructive criticism).
 - Don't be afraid to ask for clarification for something in a PR.
 - Spend time working out a schedule that all of your teammates can be in the lab/working on the project together.
 - Communicate regularly with your teammates about deadlines and expected workload for each person.
 - Complete assigned work in a timely manner.
 - Ask for help when needed.
 - When you get a pull request, review it as soon as you can.

### Working with hardware
 - Tools should be shared and not hogged. When you are done with a tool put it back and if someone else needs to use it then finish your task and pass the tool off to them
 - Don't take more than you need, taking the entire box of resistors because you don't know which one you need affects all of us. Take one at a time.
 - Tools are to be put back after you are done using them. If there is no one in line to use them, return where you found them, how you found them.
 - Always wear the proper safety gear required when using a machine or tool

### Violations
- Depending on the severity of the violation, the class will determine the corrective action. 
- Showing up for class late multiple times verbal warning. 
- When work is turned in late JJ will decide on the consequences.
- Exceptions will be made for documented extenuating circumstances.
- Students will report any violations to the professor via [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/MLevhckE3H1cGmtx8).
